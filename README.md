Objective
---------
The objective of this project is to come up with a classfication machine
learning model which identifies anomaly data/records from genuine data/records
given unclassified/unlabeled data as input. This generic objective has
application in lot of domains like Healthcare, Stocks Trading, Banking,
System Security etc. and few of the use cases are as below:

* Fradulent Medical Claim detection
* Fradulent Credit Card Transactions
* Early detection of insider trading
* Intrusion detection

Technologies used
-----------------
As the module needs to be scalable and handle Big Data involving
Hundreds of Millions of records, I have chosen to use

* Apache Spark
* H2o

My Approach
-----------
Below is the approach taken and algorithms used to solve the problem
at hand:

1. K-Means Clustering from Apache Spark MLlib
    * To identify clusters in the given unlabeled data
    * Handles Big Data and scales on a cluster of machines

2. Isolation Forest from H2o
    * To detect the Anamolies in each cluster identified in #1
    * Handles Big Data and works seamlessly with Apache Spark

3. Gradient Boosted Classification Trees from Spark MLlib
    * To create Ensemble classification model
    * Handles Big Data and scales on a cluster of machines

4. Model optimization using Apache Spark MLlib CrossValidator

5. PCA
    * Dimensionality Reduction to visualize the data in 3D

How to import and use the package?
==================================
Below is the sample usage::

        from fraudtransactiondetector import FraudTransactionClassifier
        classifier = FraudTransactionClassifier(numClusters=num_clusters,
                                                quantile=0.99)

        classifier.fit(df)
        print(classifier.modelValidationMetrics())

        # Apply it on entire Training data just to check
        results = classifier.transform(df)

        # Apply PCA and Visualize
        classifier.visualizeByApplyingPCA()

        # Select optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
        classifier.selectOptimalClusters(df)

Software Requirements
=====================
Before installing the package, please ensure that the following softwares are
installed:

    * Apache Spark 2.4.3 toward pyspark
